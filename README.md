** Linked the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to integrate the game's core functionality.
** Styled the game layout using CSS to define the visuals of the game area, player, package, and obstacle.
** Implemented player movement controls using the W, A, S, D keys and added boundary checks to restrict movement within the game area.
** Added collision detection logic to track interactions between the player, package (to increase score), and obstacle (to trigger game over).
