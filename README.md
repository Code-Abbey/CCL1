## Day 1 - 13th Jan. 2025

* Explain my Game to The Teacher

* Started working on the Game Core

## Day 2 - 14 Jan. 2025

* Set up the basic HTML structure for the game, including the game-container, player, package, and obstacle elements, along with a timer and score display.
* Linked the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to integrate the game's core functionality.
* Styled the game layout using CSS to define the visuals of the game area, player, package, and obstacle.
* Implemented player movement controls using the W, A, S, D keys and added boundary checks to restrict movement within the game area.
* Added collision detection logic to track interactions between the player, package (to increase score), and obstacle (to trigger game over).
* Developed a functional timer that counts down from 60 seconds and ends the game when it reaches zero.

## Day 3 - 15 Jan. 2025

Basically what i did today was an improvemnet on what i did yesterday
* Implemented a scrolling 2D game environment 
* Designed a road that occupies 40% of the screen width, is centrally placed, and divided into three lanes.
* Developed obstacles that randomly appear on the road, fitting into one or two lanes at a time, scrolling downward.
* Created a player character with movement restricted to the three lanes, ensuring it stays within the road boundaries.
* Added a scrolling background with placeholders for houses/buildings on both sides of the road for a more immersive experience.
* Incorporated collision detection to end the game when the player hits an obstacle.
