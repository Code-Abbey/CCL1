## Creative Code Lab 1 - WS2024

## Day 1 - 13th Jan. 2025

* Explain my Game to The Teacher
* Search for similar games
* Started working on the Game Core

## Day 2 - 14 Jan. 2025

* Set up the basic HTML structure for the game, including the game-container, player, package, and obstacle elements, along with a timer and score display.
* Linked the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to integrate the game's core functionality.
* Styled the game layout using CSS to define the visuals of the game area, player, package, and obstacle.
* Implemented player movement controls using the W, A, S, D keys and added boundary checks to restrict movement within the game area.
* Added collision detection logic to track interactions between the player, package (to increase score), and obstacle (to trigger game over).
* Developed a functional timer that counts down from 60 seconds and ends the game when it reaches zero.

## Day 3 - 15 Jan. 2025

Basically what i did today was an improvemnet on what i did yesterday
* Implemented a scrolling 2D game environment 
* Designed a road that occupies 40% of the screen width, is centrally placed, and divided into three lanes.
* Developed obstacles that randomly appear on the road, fitting into one or two lanes at a time, scrolling downward.
* Created a player character with movement restricted to the three lanes, ensuring it stays within the road boundaries.
* Added a scrolling background with placeholders for houses/buildings on both sides of the road for a more immersive experience.
* Incorporated collision detection to end the game when the player hits an obstacle.

## Day 4 - 16 Jan. 2025
Summary of Changes (Today's Work)

* Styled the dialogue between Mike and the manager as a modern chat interface, with blue messages for the manager and green messages for Mike.
* Fixed the jump mechanic by refining collision logic so the player can properly avoid obstacles while jumping.
* Organized the project into a clear structure with separate files: index.html, styles/styles.css, scripts/game.js, scripts/player.js, scripts/obstacle.js, scripts/deliveryPoint.js, scripts/road.js, scripts/environment.js, scripts/dialogue.js, and scripts/timer.js.
* Ensured the countdown timer functionality for the 90-second gameplay remains integrated and functional.
* Made the game fully responsive, including the game canvas, overlays, and dialogue box.
* Fixed bugs related to obstacle collisions and dialogue display logic.
